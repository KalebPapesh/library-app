# Library App

This is a sample app consisting of Ruby on Rails microservices and a React frontend. The backend database is SQLite3 however this would ideally be replaced by DynamoDB in the future. This app is containerized with Docker and deployed with Kubernetes.

## This is an example and not for Production!
In a production environment I would have each of these microservices in their own separate repo to enhance scalablility, enforce isolation, provide independent development, and decouple the releases
